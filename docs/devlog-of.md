# Ohad's Development Log

## 08-23-24
Initialized repository.
Drew a layout for the front panel.
Added to documentation.
Researched available controller, Raspberry Pi. Found that it is capable of performing all the functions necessary for the project.

*Notes:*
- Back of device should display the login information for the Pi, since this is a public repo and it cannot be posted here.
