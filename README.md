# Maker-space Check-in Terminal

The Check-in Terminal will be a wall mounted device used my full members to "check-in" to the space. Checking into the space will flag an indicator on the makerspace website, notifying associate members that a full member is present. This increases the value of associate memberships, as well as making membership check-in a lot easier.
